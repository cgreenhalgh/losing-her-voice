Liebe ist ein rebellischer Vogel
Nichts kann es zähmen
Und es ist sinnlos wenn man es ruft
Wenn er sich weigere….

Liebe!

Bizet’s charming opera was new in its German dress.

Our new ‘Carmen’, Fraulein Lilli Lehmann, did much to impress.

Die Liebe ist ein Kind der Bohême
Es kannte nie, nie Gesetze
Wenn du mich nicht liebst, liebe ich dich
Wenn ich dich liebe, nehm' dich in Acht !

A glorious voice!

She is the leading European prima donna we have heard

A true artist!

She sings with ease; her high notes are electrifying….

Powerful and ringing…

Die Liebe ist ein Kind der Boheme

To the eye she was a somewhat.. matronly gipsy

With her very tall stature and almost… military bearing,

Her comely countenance but severe expression…

Frau Lehmann was a most dignified Carmen
She moved even the most critical listeners… to approbation.

Miss Farrar, my dear Geraldine, it is time to start.

Thank you for seeing me, Frau Lehmann.

No student has ever made such an effort to see me, coming all the way from Melrose, Massachusetts… in America, sending nearly daily letters, including an introduction from Dame Melba herself.

It is an honor to work with someone who created roles for Herr Wagner. It is my dream to sing Elizabeth in Tannhauser.

How old are you, child?

19.

You will need a few years and a bit more meat for Elizabeth…. What will you sing now?

‘Habanera’ from ‘Carmen. In French. I apologize, I do not yet sing in German.

Proceed.

L’amour est un oiseau rebelle….

HALT! You are not…completely… without talent, but that is an unmusical phrase. Why don’t you sing it so?
L’amour est un oiseau rebelle…

Now try it again….

L’amour est un oiseau rebelle…

That is not how I sang it! Do not act your lessons!

Frau Lehmann, I am sorry but I must sing as I feel. The color must change as I change. I am not being obstinate, just… truthful…to myself.

You are a strange child, but… you may just find your way.
Still, before you ‘feel’ the music, you must be able to ‘sing’ the music… properly. You strain your voice singing as you do.

Yes, I do sometimes sound like…a cricket…

It is time, my child, to really learn…how to sing…

Your body is the instrument
which you must learn to play…
Your muscles are the strings,
which you must learn to tune
Mastering your instrument, my child
Is the greatest challenge you will face
But it is your responsibility
To serve ideal art…for the human race.

You are a singer, not a scientist, my dear
But you must understand your sensations
You have to learn how a good tone feels
And be able to replicate it.
This will take time, Geraldine
True art cannot be learned by steam
You must commit yourself
To discipline and daily practice.

Before you can sing, you must breathe
Most singers waste their air
The perfect tone soars on whirling currents you must prepare
With thoughtful coordination of diaphragm and larynx

Once you have learned to breathe,
It will be time to think of pitch
The key will be a magical exercise taught to me
By my mother when I could barely speak
It does wonders for equalizing the tone
Through your entire range
I speak of course of the Great Scale
Sung slowly on all the vowels

Prepare your lowest note with enough breath to support the highest!

If you practice the Great Scale every day,
You will eventually be ready for vocal gymnastics

And once you control your technique
It will be time to consider … expression.

I speak of expression and not your feelings
Because the true artist thinks not of herself
But the role….With every aspect of her performance serving
her conception of the work as a whole

This, my child, is how an artist embodies a masterpiece
And you will find that often the most economic gesture,
Exaggerated...
Communicates the best to a full hall.

Stop wriggling, child! It is as if you have 110 digits!
Use less of your body and more of your VOICE!

That will have to wait….

One last piece of advice…

A good singer can never lose her voice
But she can squander it
You need not be a nun, my child
But you must embrace sobriety.
No heavy food, meats or champagne
Keep warm and above all
No sitting and talking in restaurants
Early to bed and early to rise is best for the voice …and the soul.

Your body is the instrument
which you must learn to play…
Your muscles are the strings,
which you must learn to tune
Mastering your instrument, my child
Is the greatest challenge you will face
But if you apply yourself to your practice,
You will sing forever …by God’s grace!

I don’t want to sing forever. Who wants to pay to see an old Carmen?

You are still young.
Now try ‘Habanera’ again.

L’amour est un oiseau rebelle

Frau Lehmann, how did I sing?

My dear, you are an impudent girl…with some promise… if you are willing to work.
Now go home and practice.

And remember, no restaurants!

Auf wiedersehen, Frau Lehmann!

I see myself in the mirror
From the outside in
But if I am to sing, I know
It must come from within

I am not afraid to work
I will practice every day
But to be a true artist
My spirit must flow freely
Through me

I may not have the best voice
Of all the girls who dream
Of greatness on the stage
But I do have something else
I am not afraid to act the drama
Or to give all of myself

While others dream of marriage
I know what I want
I do not want children
I just want to sing

I am not afraid to fight
I know that I am worthy…
One day I will be your diva
And sing from the inside out

I will be a star… I will travel near and far… I will be a diva….

Brava!

What an entrancing voice!
You must sing for us at the palace.
Wear your finest royal lavender or black.

I shall be delighted to sing!
In white.
The <b>Prince</b> laughs and nods.

Who’s there? Who is it? Who is it?....
It’s the Crown Prince,
The Crown Prince…
The Crown Prince of Germany …

heard Miss Farrar
The Crown Prince
He saw her
Miss Farrar

The Crown Prince of Germany … touched Miss Farrar
The Crown Prince
He touched her
Miss Farrar

The Crown Prince of Germany		  KISSED Miss Farrar!
The Crown Prince of Germany	  KISSED Miss Farrar!
The Crown Prince of Germany KISSED  Miss Farrar!

This just In!

WHAT?

German Prince Loves Melrose Girl

WHO?

He invited her to sing at the palace
The German Prima Donnas are jealous and… caustic

Breaking News!

Yes?

Despite her successful Berlin debut
American subjected to constant abuse

Who does this woman think she is?
She can’t just come and steal our Crown Prince…

She can’t swoop in and take the throne
I suggest a boycott of all her shows.

Breaking News

What?

Read all about it!
The Crown Prince of Germany
The Crown Prince of Germany
The Crown Prince of Germany
WILL PROPOSE  to Miss Farrar!

No, that can’t be true!
Is there a baby on the way?

Her father punched a reporter in the face!
No doubt ashamed of his daughter’s disgrace…

I heard Frau Lehmann hid the child
These Americans are really quite unrefined & wild

She IS a great dramatic actress
Though all do not find her voice attractive

Breaking News, This Just In

WHAT?

The Crown Prince of Germany

YES?

The Crown Prince of Germany
The Crown Prince of Germany
The Crown Prince of Germany Has Invited
Miss Farrar to Sing
At the Royal HofOper in Berlin!
You can’t be serious, what a scandal!
Have you heard her? Is it true?

She first ensnared me
With her voluptuous siren song
Like a wayward sailor, I couldn’t resist
The sweet caress of her tone.

Her smile enchants me
Her gorgeous eyes enthrall
Even from a distance
Her expression pierces my very soul

Miss Farrar?

My Grace?

On behalf of the German people,
Please sing for us
At the Berlin Opera?

Yes!

His gaze ignites me
Melting away my fears
Like the royal jewels he gave me,
he elevates this New England girl.

I thrill when I see
The mischievious glint in his eye
His radiant smile engulfs me….

He is my prince

She is my star

Lighting a path through the darkness

Glowing  from afar

Is this how it feels when you finally….

Find the One?

Oh, my darling!

Yes?

No….
I swore I would be true to my dream
I must follow where this voice leads….

Thank you for being my first champion

Thank you for being my first love

She really is a tremendous talent
I always knew that she was innocent

Really a beautiful voice
And a dramatic tour de force!

Your Grace?

Yes, my darling?

I have been offered a contract by the Metropolitan Opera in New York,
But I won’t take it before our contract runs its course.

No.

You must go.
It was a privilege to have you in Berlin
Please come back in the summers and sing

Is this how it feels when you finally seize your destiny?

Thank you for being my first champion

Farewell, my first love

The New York Metropolitan, The New York Metropolitan
It is time, she must say goodbye
It is her time to go home and shine.

Did you ever love the Crown Prince? REALLY?
Do you even know how to love? REALLY?
Sure, he loved you that’s clear
But was he more than a boost for your career?
Lovely, Erotic, Exotic, Toxic,
Forget Carmen,
You were the most vicious femme fatale
Of all, we fear…

Let’s check the record
The Prince was just the first
Of a long line of men
You used to ascend
Who loved you before seeing
You are CURSED

Let’s start at the Metropolitan
Where you became America’s first homegrown star
But would you honestly be where you are
Without the support
of a cast of leading men?

There was gossip unconfirmed of course
About you and baritone Scotti
Then there was your favorite Don Jose
Caruso, leading tenor of the day

These rumors may have been grist for the mill
But these men certainly raised your prestige
And there is no doubt at all
That you proved a bitter pill
For the man who helped you the most of all

Gerry, what about Toscanini?
Your conductor truly loved you…
He gave you seven years of his life
Barely even spared a night for his wife
With his deft technique
He helped you to soar
When you cast him aside,
He couldn’t take it in stride
He resigned, which leaves us wondering…

Did you ever love the Crown Prince? REALLY?
Did you love any of them? REALLY?
They could not resist you that’s clear,
But were they more than a boost for your career?
Really? Truly? Sincerely?

Stop!

We think not!

Really, do you think that any of those men
Honestly, truly sincerely loved me?

I was not defined by these men
If anything, I would say I helped them….

We think not!

Gerry is innocent!

Look, I understand
That sometimes to play a role
The public must believe
That I am the character
But if I may be so bold…

Royal intrigue
Storybook romance
Femme fatale
All certainly have the power to entrance

My own stories were a bit more prosaic
Sure, the Crown Prince was a dear friend and patron
He gave my start but it was I who won public adoration with my art
Our puppy love wasn’t meant to endure
He married a duchess
I returned to the New World,
I did stand by him through TWO WORLD WARS

Scotti and Caruso were treasured colleagues and chums
As artists, we had quite a run
But let me be very clear
Despite what you hear
Caruso had to give up top billing for for MY Met premiere

And dear old Toscanini only came on board
After I had already scored
Thousands of fans screaming my name
Sold out houses and critics’ acclaim
I was the star who they paid to see
I was the artist of greater fame
Over seven years, I gave him every chance
He told me he loved me and yes, there was romance
But this New England girl couldn’t wait forever
I am no man’s mistress, I am diva!

You were our star!

I sang for the women
In domestic drudgery
I never had Frau Lehmann’s penchant for vocal gymnastics
But I worked, nothing could stop me.

She sang for us!

I was not afraid to find my own way
I may not have had the best voice
But I mastered my instrument
And I had this face
I never indulged, kept this figure in shape
And when it came to drama I was unafraid….

Oh, could she act!

I lived for the stage
To perform is electric
I love to tell stories…
And oh, the roles I created!

I played every imaginable woman
From Goosegirl ingenue to Madame Butterfly
I was a muse for all the greats
Massenet, Humperdinck, Strauss, Puccini
I was their dream leading lady
And perhaps my greatest triumph of all
Was Bizet’s infamous femme fatale—


I sang in Berlin, of course
Then I sang my way to stardom in New York
In the summers I sang in swanky Montecarlo
Frankly, there was hardly a hill or dale
An American or European city where I did not prevail

I was your diva!

She was our star!

I sang for all you ladies
Giving a voice to all your travails
All you in the chorus
And you out there
I sang for you in every great hall I could find
But at a certain point it wasn’t enough
And I realized it was time
To find a way at the end of the show
For you to hear me inside of your home

Ah…

Another successful debut!

Again, Miss Farrar sells out the house!

Her throngs of fans even have a name

The Gerryflappers threw Miss Farrar a parade…

Reports are in!
Miss Farrar cannot sing!
Due to illness and overwork,
The Metropolitan’s leading diva has gone hoarse!

She’s gone hoarse?!
She’s gone hoarse?!

The rumors are true
The Metropolitan has no choice
They had to replace her mid-show
Miss Farrar has lost her voice!

She’s lost her voice?!

Hello, Miss Farrar I have been trying to reach you.
This is Cecil B. Demille.
I am a director in Hollywood out in California.
And I wonder if I could interest you in silent film.

I know you are an opera singer
But we both know you are also a great actress
This is your chance to make your mark
On a form that may just become tomorrow’s art

I heard you have been ill
But we would give you top billing
If you would consider playing Carmen
In a moving picture.

Oh, and of course we will pay top dollar
Ten thousand and a private train car
Your own house and staff
And a red carpet welcome from the mayor.

Don’t answer me now.
Send me a telegram.
We will film in a month
And you can get back to New York for next season.

Gerry?

Surely, you cannot consider this!
You are an artist!
Your voice is your gem
This is not a job for a respected diva!

You belong in opera houses playing for royals
Bettering humanity with your superlative vocals
Not the nickelodeon playing for children
This is no place for a legitimate woman

Frau Lehmann, I always made my own way.
I was never just a singer but also an actress…
It is time for this American diva to explore a new frontier
To see how I fare without my voice
And bring my art from stage to screen.

Breaking news, this just in!
Gerry will light up the silver screen!
She will star in a silent Carmen!
She has lost her voice!

OK, here is the scenario…
You are in a cigarette factory
You get in a fight with the other girls
Violence and tragedy ensue
Don Jose steps in to break up the fracas
And he can’t resist your feminine wiles…

LIGHTS! CAMERA! ACTION!!

Before Gerry came to Hollywood, I admit, I was a bit… worried
In opera, a host of sins are covered by the voice’s glory.
I had coached many actors from stage to screen
And there was always an adjustment from projecting to a full hall
To the intimacy of the close-up
…You cannot lie to the camera’s eye…
But Gerry made the adjustment with no trouble at all
Her eyes were riveting with the power to enthrall.

There was always something… magical… about Gerry!

And, CUT!

Fantastic, great take, Gerry!
OK, here is the next scene
But first let me formally introduce Mr Lou Tellegen
Your leading man…

Actually, could you please get some more makeup on her? Her skin tone isn’t quite right for this light….

Now here is the scenario:
You are Carmen
He is Don Jose
You dance and he cannot resist
The sway of those hips!

Here was the thing about Gerry…
She was a star when Hollywood was still just a cow town
We were so thrilled to get her
Delighted to pay her more than anyone before
You have to understand
She was a star before there was a movie biz
Before Tinseltown with all its glitz
She had thousands of Gerry flapper fans
And she sang grand OPERA!
Not exactly everyone’s cup of tea, if you know what I mean…
She was no rock ‘n roll crooner
This woman became an international sensation singing Carmen!

AND SCENE! CUT!

Now it’s time for that final fight
After the bull scene for which we will get a real crowd
Possible with movie magic…
You tell him you’re leaving
He won’t take no
Here is his knife, now go!

Could we get some more makeup, please?

Great! Lights! Camera! Action!

And let me tell you this about Gerry
She may have been the world’s reigning diva
But all the crew knew by day two
She was Gerry, not Miss Farrar!

My God the woman was salt of the earth
A consummate professional
Early for every scene, happy to take direction
Never a complaint, even when delayed in the hot sun and dirt
We gave her our very best dressing room
She didn’t care that the previous occupant had been a quite respectable… mare
Just got to work, still practiced her scales
Never arrogant even when people couldn’t help but stare…
Unafraid to bring grand old opera to the spanking new silver screen…

There really was something …extraordinary…about Gerry.

Bravi! That’s a day.
Gerry, if I may…
I would like to get better contrast for your beautiful eyes.
Would you mind stepping into this box
So that we can work on the close-ups and find just the right light?

I remember the first time I saw you
A startling vision of loveliness
In gypsy dress
I knew I had to have you
I could barely restrain myself on set

I have lived all over the world, my dear
And certainly had quite a career
From illegitimate son in Holland
To the circus, then prison in Russia
From gambler on the Riviera
To Sarah Bernhardt’s leading man in America
Darling, I was the greatest lover there ever was
And…you were….

You were my ideal love…
Better than booze or…snuff
The thrill of the gambling hall
Was really nothing at all
Compared to the feeling
I had when seizing
Your heart, my sweet
Oh, what a feat!

Sure, there were a few women before
Of course, there was my first wife
Mother of my child
But it wasn’t quite right
I mean, we would sometimes fight
And she would never let me go out at night
She was an artist but really a bore, my dear
She was happy to free me, sincerely
We both knew I was meant for another sphere

There were others, of course
I mean, look at this
It would have been cruel to deny them
I had a few trysts
I can’t help it…
Women were kind to me
But they were all really practice
So that I could claim
The greatest prize
A woman of staggering beauty and fame….

You were my ideal love…
Better than booze or…snuff
The thrill of the gambling hall
Was really nothing at all
Compared to the feeling
I had when seizing
Your heart, my sweet
Oh, what a feat!

I know you promised to never let a man
Stand in the way of your work
And those other men, what can I say
They were really… jerks
Not one of them really understood
The true art of romance
I never gave up – calls, letters, telegrams
I was always there
And finally, I knew you could not resist
The greatest gesture of all, my darling

Remember when I proposed?
The day I truly made you mine?
Miss Farrar became Mrs Tellegen
Oh, my darling – what a glorious, wondrous magical day it was!
When you were my bride.

You were our ideal love
We couldn’t get enough
You made us feel
Storybook romance was real
Really so beautiful
And genteel
Leading lives that gave us chills
You were our IDEAL LOVE!

Is this how you see me?
I suppose that is what I wanted you to see!
Sadly there is more to the story
Where to begin…

You were my ideal love
But that was just a ROLE you played
You made me believe
I was your queen
You followed me long after our last scene
With love letters, roses, and flattery
But, I can honestly say, looking back at what we had,
…You are a cad!

Lou- No, my darling!

I promised that I would never let a man
Keep me from living my dreams
I never thought of marriage
I knew I wanted to be free!

But then there was you
So incredibly handsome
With charm and charisma to spare
Who can blame me
For taking a chance
For God’s sake, Rodin used you as the model
For a statue of the ideal lover
You literally
Embodied ROMANCE!

And for awhile, everything was divine
It was the best of times…
We moved into a gorgeous apartment
On the best street in Manhattan…
The world was green with envy
We were the toast of every party
But too soon, cracks appeared
You were never home in the evening
I had to wake up early to practice vocalises
Then perhaps, worst of all,
I started risking my career
I insisted that you appear
In all of my silent films

Demille warned me it was a mistake
But I loved you so much I was willing to insist
That you should even get top billing,
I mean, what man can tolerate playing second fiddle
To the love of his life?

But no matter what I did,
It was never enough for you
And soon enough, there were whispers and rumours
That turned to full blown scandal

You committed adultery
With a seemingly endless stream
Of lovely young ladies
And yet when I finally
Sued for divorce
You still had the audacity to play victim for the papers

How could you? How could I?
How could I ever believe?
That an ideal love exists?
Just because of your well-practiced kiss?
How could your act take in
the world’s greatest actress?

You were my ideal love
But that was just a ROLE you played
You made me believe
I was your queen
You followed me long after our last scene
With love letters, roses, and flattery
But, I can honestly say, looking back at what we had,
…You are a…

CAD!

Get away! You are better seen and not heard…

Gerry?

Yes.

I am sorry but your films aren’t selling like they were. Now, in your contract, we have you down for three more films but…

Thank you.

Yes?

Mrs Tellegen, er Miss Farrar, we are sorry to report. We have to cut the value of your Metropolitan Opera contract in half….

My child

Frau Lehmann!

My dear, what is it?

Oh Frau Lehmann, everything is falling apart. I should have listened. Hollywood was a mistake.

Geraldine, I saw you in Carmen on film…. I was wrong. You were… riveting.

Thank you.

So much has changed…

The Berlin you knew is shattered
Bombs have left their scars
The opera house is in ruins
And the royals have fled abroad.

Food is rationed, we often starve
So many friends are gone
But I still have all that I need
My child, I still have my art.

The Great Scale healed me from sickness
Practice gave me my voice
And, Geraldine, it has not been easy
But I have continued to make the choice

I sing every day
And when I sing, I am free
No matter what horrors I face,
The Great Scale brings me peace, serenity and grace

Now you face your own problems
But my dear you have all you need
Practice the Great Scale
It is your creed

You will sing forever
Your strong spirit will prevail
And your art will lift you
From this strife
I promise you
The Great Scale
Will get you through….

Nothing else matters, No one else matters

I promise you
The Great Scale
Will transport you
Will get you through….

Oh my darling Frau Lehmann,
I am so sorry for your pain.
I feel so foolish for my tears…
You are so wise, art can conquer all fears

And I will do all that I can to help you.
I will send you all I can…

But…

I always knew I would not be an old Carmen….
It is time to find my next dream….
I will never give up my daily practice
But I think… it may be time to leave….

Nothing else matters, No one else matters

I have loved being your diva
But it is my time
To find my next place… to shine

Nothing else matters, No one else matters

Farewell, my dearest teacher

Farewell, my pupil. I am proud… of your success.

Breaking News!
This Just In!
Gerry will leave….
The Metropolitan

No!

They have shut down Broadway
No athletic team has ever had such an enormous ticker tape parade

No! I can’t bear to see her go!!!
We cannot miss her very last show…

Hurrah, Farrar! Farrar, hurrah!


There is uproarious applause

Hurrah, Farrar! Farrar, hurrah!

Twenty years ago
I slaved that achievement might be mine…
That I might be a prophetess in my own country
But I never thought…
It would be like this

I don’t want a tear shed in this house today

I can’t help it, I’ve already wept bushels….

Gerry! Gerry!

I am leaving this institution because I want to
But that does not mean farewell to you
I still have many plans

Hurrah, Farrar! Farrar, hurrah!

These have been sixteen years of happiness,
Such great happiness that if I died tonight
I would not regret it
I love you all dearly,
But we are weary
And we must say goodbye.

Hurrah, Farrar! Farrar, hurrah!

<b>Lou
</b>
Gerry, Gerry! Please….You can’t just ignore  me….

Hurrah, Farrar! Farrar, hurrah!

<b>Lou
</b>
For God’s sake, won’t anyone look at me?
I don’t understand
I was your matinee idol –

Hurrah, Farrar! Farrar, hurrah!

<b>Lou
</b>
I am still your Lou, darling! Please, let’s have a word.

Hurrah, Farrar! Farrar, hurrah!

<b>Lou
</b>
I can’t stand it anymore. Damn you and damn the talkies!

Lou Tellegen killed himself. Any comment?

Why should that interest me?

I refused to be an aging Carmen
And yet here I am
Captured in the bloom of youth
In celluloid and vinyl.

I sang for my public
They saw me so intimately
They brought my voice inside of their homes
But…did they ever know me?

Now I perform for you who never knew me
You hear my voice echoing across time
You see me flickering on your screens
Or at least my apparition

I live on in the stories I told
And the stories told about me
Newspapers and magazine headlines
Flash at the click of a button

Is it me who you see?
Can you hear me sing?
Years after my last Gerryflapper died…

Do I live on in my reflections?

Will I degrade
Have I decayed

Or…

Can I live on…

In my reflections?
