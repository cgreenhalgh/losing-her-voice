{"html":"<h2>Composers Programme Note</h2><p>I first encountered Geraldine Farrar’s silent film ‘Carmen’ while preparing my ‘Composing for Words, Theatre &amp; Moving Image’ module in 2017. I became fascinated by how ‘losing her voice’ impacted Farrar’s captivating performance, as she brought the European ‘Carmen’ to the American silver screen. As a former Angeleno, I found it intriguing to think back to the early twentieth-century when pioneering directors like Cecil B. Demille looked to opera for plotlines – and stars —as they sought to establish the fledgling medium. Farrar’s devoted fan base of female ‘Gerryflappers’ also drew my attention, especially as she was active during the pivotal period around women’s suffrage in the United States. I was keen to explore Farrar’s experiences as one of the first bestselling recording artists and an early screen actress, and to consider how media might have amplified Farrar’s celebrity.  </p>"},
{"html":"<p>As I delved into research at the Geraldine Farrar archive, housed in Washington’s Library of Congress, a bold and artistically assured woman came into focus alongside a cast of equally extraordinary artists – her mentor, Lilli Lehmann, Cecil B. Demille and her great love, the charming yet tragic actor Lou Tellegen – whose lives proved more remarkable than fiction. I have sought to capture some of the flavour of these individuals – and the press coverage surrounding them – in the libretto. In the music, I quote Bizet’s <i>Carmen</i> and draw influence from Romantic opera, early twentieth-century American popular song and jazz, as I seek to take this incredible story of operatic translation into the twenty-first century. </p>"},
{"html":"<p>Creating opera is a truly collaborative process, more so than typical concert music, and I have been fortunate to work with a team of collaborators through the composition process, most notably the University of Nottingham Mixed Reality Lab, who have developed a web app that enables Farrar to make the transition from stage to silver screen to your individual mobile phone screen, linking historical fan culture to the ‘fandom’ facilitated by social media today. </p>"}

He sings about how they met and how she is his ideal love, musing that his love for her was more intoxicating than his other addictions and her affections were more thrilling than the adoration of his fans. As he speaks, Geraldine wildly sings on-stage. Her vocal gestures begin to impact her projected image. His song is in the style of a 1910s waltz popular song like ‘Let Me Call You Sweetheart’.</p><p>After Lou sings, the chorus rises from the audience to sing about how Geraldine & Lou were their ideal love. As they sing, (real) newspaper & magazines appear portraying their ideal love. Perhaps Lou signs autographs or has picture taken? Geraldine’s gestures continue to distort images. </p><p>For the first time this act, Geraldine sings. The screen projects newspaper images of her actual marriage to Tellegen with scenes from ‘Carmen’. The images shift in response to Geraldine’s voice as she sings ‘Is this How You See Me’ and chronicles the rise and fall of her relationship with Tellegen and her silent film career. She fights with Lou about the true course of their relationship and eventually pushes him behind the screen, where he is trapped. </p><p>There will be some improvisatory aspects to this aria and interaction between soprano/image. </p><p>At the end, Cecil B. Demille tells her that her movies are failing financially, and she tears up her contract. She receives a call from the Met telling her that her salary will be cut. Image freezes and the screen then goes dark as she slams down phone.</p>" }

Geraldine sees Lilli’s reflection in the mirror. </p><p>Lilli sings to Geraldine about the dire situation in post-war Germany saying that the Crown Prince has been deposed and his son now works at a Ford factory. She suggests that Geraldine can get through all her problems by continuing with her ‘great scale’ practice, which will allow her to sing forever.
