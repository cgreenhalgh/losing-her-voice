{"html":"<h2>Composers Programme Note</h2><p>I first encountered Geraldine Farrar’s silent film ‘Carmen’ while preparing my ‘Composing for Words, Theatre &amp; Moving Image’ module in 2017. I became fascinated by how ‘losing her voice’ impacted Farrar’s captivating performance, as she brought the European ‘Carmen’ to the American silver screen. As a former Angeleno, I found it intriguing to think back to the early twentieth-century when pioneering directors like Cecil B. Demille looked to opera for plotlines – and stars —as they sought to establish the fledgling medium. Farrar’s devoted fan base of female ‘Gerryflappers’ also drew my attention, especially as she was active during the pivotal period around women’s suffrage in the United States. I was keen to explore Farrar’s experiences as one of the first bestselling recording artists and an early screen actress, and to consider how media might have amplified Farrar’s celebrity.  </p>"},
{"html":"<p>As I delved into research at the Geraldine Farrar archive, housed in Washington’s Library of Congress, a bold and artistically assured woman came into focus alongside a cast of equally extraordinary artists – her mentor, Lilli Lehmann, Cecil B. Demille and her great love, the charming yet tragic actor Lou Tellegen – whose lives proved more remarkable than fiction. I have sought to capture some of the flavour of these individuals – and the press coverage surrounding them – in the libretto. In the music, I quote Bizet’s <i>Carmen</i> and draw influence from Romantic opera, early twentieth-century American popular song and jazz, as I seek to take this incredible story of operatic translation into the twenty-first century. </p>"},
{"html":"<p>Creating opera is a truly collaborative process, more so than typical concert music, and I have been fortunate to work with a team of collaborators through the composition process, most notably the University of Nottingham Mixed Reality Lab, who have developed a web app that enables Farrar to make the transition from stage to silver screen to your individual mobile phone screen, linking historical fan culture to the ‘fandom’ facilitated by social media today. </p>"}
